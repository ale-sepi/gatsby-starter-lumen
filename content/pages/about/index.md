Hey there!
Welcome to my personal blog! I'm super stoked that you're here. My name is Alessio, and I'm a mechanical engineer who's all about automating things and rocking computer-aided design.

Having been born at the end of "good old analog days", I've experienced firsthand the remarkable evolution of technology and the profound impact it has had on our lives. The internet has been an invaluable companion on my journey to knowledge. It has served as a vast repository of information, enabling me to learn, explore, and grow both personally and professionally. The tremendous amount of resources available online has certainly facilitated my own development and now it's the time to pay it forward. That's why I've set up this blog â€“ to share the wealth of knowledge and experiences I've gained along the way.

Through this blog, I aim to channel my passion for automate things and computer-aided design into a platform where I can share my knowledge, insights, and discoveries. It's my way of contributing to the vast digital landscape that has provided me with so much.

Thank you for joining me on this adventure.

Alessio Sepicacchi
